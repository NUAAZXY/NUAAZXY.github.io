# 👀 About Me

I am pursuing my PhD degree at the College of Computer Science and Technology of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

I have published papers in prestigious conferences and journals including ACL, TSE, TOSEM, EMNLP, and JSS. My research work can be found on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j2XgDxUAAAAJ).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on:
- Code Generation
- Interpretability of LLMs
